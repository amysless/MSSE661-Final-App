# A Tasty Treat 


### Description
A Tasty Treat is a casual cooking school offering a variety of cooking classes. They offer one day to one week cooking classes to the public. One day classes are often the students cooking a meal and then eating it as an event. Weeklong cooking classes are a more focused treatment of baking, basic French cooking, etc.  They have a small international team, with different backgrounds and experiences, who all work with a common value: the desire to share their "savoir faire" and passion with the guest.  

Each class format differs, but all have a common thread: it is just as much about learning as it is about enjoying your time doing so.  They have kitchens that resemble a home kitchen - purposefully - so that guests can replicate the dishes at home. A Tasty Treat aim to make all the cooking classes as hands-on as possible â€“ though some will naturally be more so than others.
